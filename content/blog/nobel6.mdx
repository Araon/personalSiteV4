It didn't take long for Reach to fall. Our enemy was ruthless, efficient. But they weren't nearly fast enough.

For you had already passed the torch. And because of you, we found Halo.

Our victory, Your victory

was so close. I wish you could have lived to see it.

But, you belong to Reach.

Your body and armor all burned and turned to glass.

Everything, except your courage, That you gave to us. And with it, we can rebuild.
