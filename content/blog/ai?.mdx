### The AI Hype Train  

Apple Intelligence has been out for a couple of months now. Like so many other AI promises, it’s fallen a little short, hasn’t it?  

The hype around AI is fueled by visions of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**—the kind we see in movies. From HAL and C-3PO to WALL-E and JARVIS, pop culture gives us this tantalizing idea of AI that “just works.” But here we are in 2024, with promises still far ahead of reality.  

Take Apple Intelligence as an example:  

> **“Almost useless.”**  
> —Marques Brownlee  

Marques pointed out two highlights:  
1. The background eraser tool is solid.  
2. Apple bumped up the base RAM across all hardware. (Finally!)  

But otherwise? Mediocre.  

> **“You have to be an idiot to like Apple Intelligence.”**  
> —CNET  

CNET didn’t hold back either, and for good reason. Apple Intelligence was announced back in June 2024 at WWDC, yet it shipped late, offering underwhelming features with promises that "the really good stuff" is still to come.

### AI Success: When It Works, We Stop Calling It AI  

To understand AI, let’s tighten up our definitions and give credit where it’s due. **Artificial Intelligence** encompasses many fields that are already well-integrated into our lives:  

- Searching your photos by content (not filename).  
- Near-perfect voice recognition.  
- Generative tools that edit photos seamlessly.  

These are all AI tools, yet we don’t call them AI anymore. As Tim Minchin famously said:  

> **“Do you know what they call alternative medicine that’s been proved to work? Medicine.”**  

When AI works, it fades into the background of our daily tech experience.

### GenAI, GPT, and Large Language Models (LLMs)  

This blog is about **Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and GPT**—technologies that companies hype endlessly but often deliver little.  

For instance, LLMs excel at **comprehending language**. Want synonyms for "despair"? They’ll give you a nuanced list in seconds. But rely on them for **knowledge** or complex specifics, and you’ll hit limitations fast.  

Here’s a case in point:  

- Asked about the instruments in Aerosmith’s *Dream On*, ChatGPT claimed piano and harpsichord. It got harpsichord right but missed the Mellotron.  
- Gemini got "harpsichord" correct but missed the Mellotron entirely.  

The more specific the question, the less reliable the answer.

### GPT Tools: Great at Approximate Knowledge  

LLMs remind me of the Demon Cat from *Adventure Time*—confidently delivering approximate knowledge of many things. This confidence masks limitations, making these tools seem more capable than they really are.  

Here’s why:  

1. **Training Data**: LLMs rely on massive datasets to learn. They do great with well-documented topics but struggle when training data is scarce (e.g., niche research).  
2. **Mathematics**: While "1+1=2" is easy, complex equations like "2e² + 5j = 0" aren’t. Why? Such specifics lack sufficient training data.  

The result? GPT tools work brilliantly for broad, shallow exploration but fall apart with complex or niche tasks.

### Why Companies Overpromise  

If AI tools don’t work as advertised, why do companies keep making these wild promises?  

The answer lies in **capitalism**:  

1. **Investors**: AI companies aren’t just selling to customers—they’re selling to investors. Features are rushed out to impress backers, even if they don’t work well.  
2. **Hype vs. Reality**: It’s easier to sell the *promise* of technology than to build reliable products.  

As a result, broken or mediocre AI features get crammed into everything—from our apps to our notifications—because the real goal is securing more funding, not solving real problems.

### Conclusion: Focus on What Works Today  

Generative AI has immense value, especially for initial research or creative inspiration. But we must temper expectations. Instead of buying into hype about the future, focus on what AI can genuinely do **right now**.  

And as always: if you’re unsure whether a tech promise is real, ask yourself—does it actually work today?
